# Mastering React Hooks: A Deep Dive into Modern React Development

React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components, making functional components just as powerful as class components while keeping the code cleaner and more reusable. In this post, we'll explore some advanced patterns and best practices for using React Hooks effectively.

## Understanding the Basics

Before diving into advanced patterns, let's refresh our understanding of the core hooks:

\`\`\`javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = \`Count: \${count}\`;
  }, [count]);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Click me: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Hook Patterns

### Custom Hooks
Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions:

\`\`\`javascript
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 0, height: 0 });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight
      });
    };
    
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    handleResize();
    
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);
  
  return size;
}
\`\`\`

### Hook Dependencies
Understanding dependencies in useEffect is crucial:

\`\`\`javascript
function SearchComponent({ query }) {
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      const data = await searchApi(query);
      setResults(data);
    }
    
    fetchData();
  }, [query]); // Only re-run when query changes
  
  return <ResultsList results={results} />;
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Hooks at the Top Level**
   - Don't put hooks inside conditions or loops
   - Always use hooks at the top level of your function

2. **Use Multiple Effects for Separate Concerns**
   - Split effects by their purpose
   - Makes code more maintainable

3. **Memoization with useMemo and useCallback**
   - Optimize performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations
   - Use when dealing with expensive computations

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a powerful way to manage state and side effects in functional components. By following these patterns and best practices, you can write more maintainable and efficient React applications.

Remember to:
- Keep your hooks simple and focused
- Use custom hooks to share logic
- Pay attention to dependencies
- Profile performance before optimizing

Happy coding!`;

# Building a Modern Portfolio Website with React and Material-UI

Creating a portfolio website that stands out is crucial for any developer or designer. In this post, I'll share my experience building a modern, responsive portfolio using React and Material-UI, with a focus on performance and user experience.

## Why React and Material-UI?

The combination of React and Material-UI offers several advantages:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Reusable components
   - Easy maintenance
   - Clean code structure

2. **Material Design System**
   - Consistent UI/UX
   - Responsive by default
   - Customizable themes

## Setting Up the Project

First, create a new React project with Material-UI:

\`\`\`bash
npx create-react-app portfolio --template typescript
cd portfolio
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
\`\`\`

## Key Features

### 1. Responsive Navigation

\`\`\`typescript
import { AppBar, Toolbar, IconButton, Drawer } from '@mui/material';

function Navigation() {
  const [mobileOpen, setMobileOpen] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <>
      <AppBar position="fixed">
        <Toolbar>
          {/* Navigation items */}
        </Toolbar>
      </AppBar>
      <Drawer
        variant="temporary"
        open={mobileOpen}
        onClose={() => setMobileOpen(false)}
      >
        {/* Mobile navigation items */}
      </Drawer>
    </>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### 2. Project Showcase

\`\`\`typescript
function ProjectCard({ title, description, image, tags }) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardMedia
        component="img"
        height="200"
        image={image}
        alt={title}
      />
      <CardContent>
        <Typography variant="h6">{title}</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">{description}</Typography>
        {tags.map(tag => (
          <Chip key={tag} label={tag} />
        ))}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Dark Mode Support

\`\`\`typescript
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material';

function App() {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
  
  const theme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      mode: darkMode ? 'dark' : 'light',
    },
  });
  
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* App content */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
\`\`\`

## Performance Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Use React.lazy for route-based code splitting
   - Implement suspense boundaries

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Compress images
   - Use responsive images
   - Implement lazy loading

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement analytics
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
   - Use React DevTools for profiling

## Deployment

Deploy your portfolio using Vercel or Netlify for optimal performance:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Building a modern portfolio with React and Material-UI allows you to create a professional, responsive website that showcases your work effectively. Remember to:

- Focus on user experience
- Optimize performance
- Keep content up to date
- Monitor analytics

Your portfolio is often the first impression potential clients or employers have of your work. Make it count!`;

# The Future of Web Development: Trends and Technologies to Watch

As we move forward in the digital age, web development continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Let's explore some of the most exciting trends and technologies that are shaping the future of web development.

## 1. AI-Powered Development

Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing how we build websites and applications:

### Code Generation
\`\`\`javascript
// Example of AI-assisted code generation
const AIComponent = async (prompt) => {
  const response = await aiCodeGenerator.generate({
    prompt,
    language: 'javascript',
    framework: 'react'
  });
  return response.code;
};
\`\`\`

### Automated Testing
AI-powered testing tools can:
- Generate test cases
- Identify potential bugs
- Optimize performance

## 2. WebAssembly (Wasm)

WebAssembly is enabling high-performance web applications:

\`\`\`rust
#[no_mangle]
pub fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}
\`\`\`

Benefits:
- Near-native performance
- Language interoperability
- Secure execution

## 3. Edge Computing

Moving computation closer to users:

\`\`\`javascript
// Edge function example
export async function onRequest(context) {
  const cache = caches.default;
  let response = await cache.match(context.request);

  if (!response) {
    response = await fetch(context.request);
    context.waitUntil(cache.put(context.request, response.clone()));
  }

  return response;
}
\`\`\`

Advantages:
- Reduced latency
- Better performance
- Lower bandwidth costs

## 4. Web Components

Creating reusable custom elements:

\`\`\`javascript
class CustomCard extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = \`
      <style>
        :host {
          display: block;
          border-radius: 8px;
          box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
        }
      </style>
      <slot></slot>
    \`;
  }
}

customElements.define('custom-card', CustomCard);
\`\`\`

## 5. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

PWAs continue to evolve with new capabilities:

\`\`\`javascript
// Service Worker registration
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker
    .register('/sw.js')
    .then(registration => {
      console.log('SW registered:', registration);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log('SW registration failed:', error);
    });
}
\`\`\`

Features:
- Offline functionality
- Push notifications
- Native-like experience

## 6. No-Code and Low-Code Platforms

Democratizing web development:
- Visual development tools
- AI-assisted development
- Component libraries

## Looking Ahead

The future of web development is exciting and challenging:

1. **Sustainability**
   - Green hosting
   - Efficient code
   - Reduced carbon footprint

2. **Privacy and Security**
   - Zero-trust architecture
   - Enhanced encryption
   - Privacy-first design

3. **Cross-Platform Development**
   - Universal applications
   - Consistent experiences
   - Shared codebases

## Conclusion

Stay ahead by:
- Learning continuously
